# Gao Decoder for Reed-Solomon Codes in Go

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of the Gao decoder for Reed-Solomon error-correcting codes in Go. The Gao decoder is an efficient algebraic decoding algorithm that corrects errors and erasures in Reed-Solomon encoded messages without explicitly computing a syndrome.

<!-- ## Features
- **Efficient decoding** of Reed-Solomon codes using the Gao method.
- **Support for customizable parameters**, including field size and error correction capability.
- **Simple API** for encoding and decoding messages.
- **Optimized for performance** using Go's native capabilities. -->

## Installation
To use the Gao decoder in your Go project, install it using:

```sh
 go get github.com/jonathanmweiss/go-gao
```

Then, import it in your code:

```go
 import "github.com/jonathanmweiss/go-gao"
```

## Usage
See unit tests for example.


## Planned Improvements:

- Implementing positive-wrapped and negative-wrapped NTT forward evaluation for fast encoding.
- Roots of unity fast decoding (Reducing the algorithms runtime from O(n^2 * logn) to O(n^2)).
- Optimised decoding for erasure only (erasure only faults decrease redundancies).
- Code optimisations to reduce allocations (and GC).
- Remove the Lattigo import by implementing a prime factorization algorithm (and switch to the MIT license).
